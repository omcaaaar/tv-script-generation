# tv-script-generation

In this project, we'll generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. We'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

**Packages required to run the code**

1. torch
2. numpy

Note : The code is written in python 3 and the framework used is PyTorch.
